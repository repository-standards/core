description: Produce the implementation plan for a clarified spec; refuses a spec that fails the clarify gate (based on github/spec-kit v0.13.2, MIT - scripts/spec/LICENSE)

<!-- Based on github/spec-kit v0.13.2 (MIT - scripts/spec/LICENSE). PATCHED hunks are marked inline. -->
<!-- PATCHED(repository-standards): ADR-010 clarify gate - mandatory precheck before planning -->
**MANDATORY PRECHECK - the clarify gate.** Before anything else in this command, run `scripts/spec/check-spec-clarified.sh <FEATURE_SPEC>` from the repo root (resolve `FEATURE_SPEC` via `scripts/spec/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only`). If it exits non-zero, STOP and run the clarify loop (`/spec-clarify`) - do not plan a spec that is not ready-to-develop (a spec is ready only when it has a `## Clarifications` section and zero open `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION` markers).

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `scripts/spec/setup-plan.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and, IF EXISTS, `specs/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

## Completion Report

Command ends after Phase 1 design. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Define interface contracts** (if project has external interfaces) → `/contracts/`:
   - Identify what interfaces the project exposes to users or other systems
   - Document the contract format appropriate for the project type
   - Examples: public APIs for libraries, command schemas for CLI tools, endpoints for web services, grammars for parsers, UI contracts for applications
   - Skip if project is purely internal (build scripts, one-off tools, etc.)

3. **Create quickstart validation guide** → `quickstart.md`:
   - Document runnable validation scenarios that prove the feature works end-to-end
   - Include prerequisites, setup commands, test/run commands, and expected outcomes
   - Use links or references to contracts and data model details instead of duplicating them
   - Do not include full implementation code, model/service/controller bodies, migrations, or complete test suites
   - Keep this artifact as a validation/run guide; implementation details belong in `tasks.md` and the implementation phase

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths for filesystem operations; use project-relative paths for references in documentation
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications

## Done When

- [ ] Plan workflow executed and design artifacts generated
- [ ] Completion reported to user with branch, plan path, and generated artifacts
